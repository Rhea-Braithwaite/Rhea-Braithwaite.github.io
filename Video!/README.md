## Project Name: Finding Tutoruu

## Project Description: 
A freshmen/sophomore student struggling/overwhelmed/anxious/ by an intense workload finds help with the app Tutoruu.

### What is it?
An interactive web and film experience where the user tries to help the student tackle their workload. However, their efforts are not sufficient and the student eventually finds the tutoring app Tutoruu.  

### Overall Concept and Theme
A student is struggling and overwhelmed with their classes/assignments/projects and is trying to find ways to get help. They try different solutions such as getting help from the Professor/TA, checking Google and contacting classmates. However nothing helps. They then try Tutoruu the app. On the app they are able to find different tutors that took the same class theyâ€™re struggling in and text them if they can really help with their problem. They then meet with a tutor and finally they succeed at finishing their assignment and he/she is relieved.

### Desired Experience
By being able to make the decisions to help the student, we hope the user will in some way empathize with the protagonist. Moreover, if the user is potentially a student they may be able to find the app helpful by connecting them with tutors. 

## Process: 

### Brainstorming
We began the process by brainstorming a storyline to use. Seif and his partner Youssef having launched the app Tutoruu, suggested having a film to highlight the usefulness of the app. We then drew an outline of the various scenes, separating them into Beginning, Midpoint Escalation and Conclusion. We also identified the various decision options for each scene. Then we divided the roles into those focusing on filming, Sadeq and Seif, and the website, Rhea and Moyo. And then we began working on our respective parts. 

### Filming
#### Sadeq

#### Seif

### Website
For the website we started off by coming up with a wireframe of how we wanted the website to look. Then we finally implemented it. 

#### Moyo

#### Rhea
My primary focus was interactivity. I worked on ensuring that the correct videos were played depending on what option the user chose. I also had to ensure the other option was invisible if only one option was left. When creating the website, I largely followed the scheme that Seif and Youssef already had on their website, and added our video and interactivity components.
