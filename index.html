              <h4>30 Minute Film Festival (n.)</h4>
              A 30 Minute Film Festival is an event organized by a group of individuals within 30 minutes.
              These persons split into groups, come up with an idea, then film and edit it in 30 minutes.
              Here is one such film "4 Years in College". We hope you enjoy it and scroll down further to learn
              more about our process.

          <h4 >Video Deep Dive </h4>
            <p class="intro"> Our 30 minute festival was done in our Communications Lab class with Professor Michael Ang
              We wanted to highlight that the 3 to 4 years that one spends in college
              can help to form who an individual becomes in the years to come.
              4 Years, though it may seem a short time in the larger span of things, can contain a myriad of memories of
              experiences for an individual. Within the video, "4 Years of College",
              we see this clearly. Take a short journey through Freshman, Sophomore,
              Junior and Senior year from the perspective of 4 students, who share
              their emotions and feelings during this time period.
            </p>

              <h5>Why College?</h5>
                <p>The brainstorming process for our film was a real struggle. Initally there had been a thought to meet on campus
                  to do the film with all of us in person, but that proved impossible, as not everyone was on campus.
                  Then Seif mentioned that we could speak about our feelings in college. And from there the connection was made that
                  given we were in different years, we could each film a testimonial for each year. Therefore the viewer can see
                  how these feelings can morph over the years, and most importantly our individual journeys.

          <h4>Our Process</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>Brainstorming and finalising an idea. Apps like Zoom prove useful, as it is easy to discuss, share the content
                that we may want to add to the film, and view the film before the final screening.</li>
              <li>Then we divided up who would do what. We all lacked major film/film editing experience, but we decided to simply use our phones to do
                make our individual videos. And Seif volunteered to do the editing.</li>
              <li>Then we split up to film our respective sections, then upload them to Google Drive and share the link with Seif, so he could access them.</li>
              <li>Finally, Seif combined all the videos together and did any additional editing using IMovie and shared it with us for any comments or suggestions.</li>
              <li>And that was that. Admittedly we did not completely stick to 30 minutes precisely, but the film was created and cut within 45 minutes.</li>
