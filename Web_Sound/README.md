## Project Name: Time Traveller

## Project Description: 
### What is it?
"Time Traveller" is a website that provides the viewer with an auitory experience of technology through time. 
### Overall Concept and Theme

### Desired Experience

## Process: 

### Brainstorming
We began by meeting to come up with an initial idea. Seif had suggested using the natural elements, including animals, humans and how they've caused sound pollution and ruined the sounds of nature. We built on that by considering what caused the pollution, humanity's dirve for technological innovation, and we decided that this could be shown through sound. To keep that element of human destruction, we decided to add the thermometer as an active reminder. 


### Audio
#### Moyo


#### Yunho
I worked mainly on mixing the sound samples provided by Moyo with some no copyright background music to enhance the user's experience. My main aim was to make the sound feel as if the user is actually in the middle of the scene. By adding a multiple layer of the same sound samples with different volumes, the sound provides a sense of distance (sound from away and close).



### Website
#### Seif


#### Rhea
I worked on implementing the website design and animations. As we had met and come up with a basic design, I created the web page, added the images and used the AOS library to addd fade ins. Then I worked on the thermometer. The desired effect was to have it "fill" as you scrolled along, to signal that although we've experienced technological innovation throughout the eras, that has been supplemented by a rise in our global temperatures. Initially it filled from the bottom, but I could only figure out how to do that with one color. So the alternative that I found was to have a coloured image of the thermometer, and then have an overlying rectangle, that got smaller as you scrolled along.
