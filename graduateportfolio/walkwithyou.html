        <p class="overview">Overview: Mobile application that provides users with tools to make their
          traveling journey safer.
          <br> Developed as part of The Summer Environmental
          Education Development (SEEDs) program, an annual intensive 10-week mobile
          app development hackathon. It provides an opportunity for female college
          students to gain coding experience and work with a non-profit.

          </br> </br> I was paired with another participant, Jasmine, and we worked
          together on each phase of the app development.  </p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="project-heading">Early Steps</h2>
      <p class="text"> We wanted to explore the problem domain of Women’s Safety, operating
      from our own personal experiences as young women navigating daily life.
      After conducting initial research it was statistically clear, this wasn’t
      isolated to us and very much universal. </p>

        <img src="images/projects/seeds/violence2.png" alt="Violence in Canada and China" class="project-img3">
      </div>


      <h2 class="project-heading"> Problem Statement </h2>
      <p class="text">The final question we landed on as our problem statement then became: <strong>How might we help females or people, feel safer and more protected when traveling?</strong> </p>

    <h2 class="project-heading">Target Group and User Interviews</h2>
    <p class="text">We used this baseline to nail down our primary user base (women) and
      conducted interviews to outline their transportation journey and identify
      paint points our app could improve.  </p>
      <img src="images/projects/seeds/interviews.png" alt="Interviews" class="project-img1">

      <h2 class="project-heading">Ideation and Prototyping </h2>
      <p class="text">This led to the app’s key features and their specific offerings:</p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Feature</th>
          <th>Offering</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Emergency call buttons</td>
          <td>Pre-saved emergency contacts and messages, to immediately convey
            that you are worried for your safety. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Phone call simulator</td>
          <td>Using pre-recorded conversations so you can simulate talking to
            someone over the phone</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Self-defense resources</td>
          <td>Learn self-defense skills on the go, so you can use them in the
            event of an emergency</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p class="text">We then worked on low-fi prototype sketches of each feature </p>

        <img src="images/projects/seeds/rhea_lowfi.png" alt="Low Fidelity Prototypes" class="project-img1">
      </div>
      <p> and then transformed them into high fidelity versions in Figma.</p>

      <h2 class="project-heading">Final Product</h2>
      <p class="text">I then coded the final app in Android Studio using the Kotlin programming language.</p>

      <h2 class="project-heading">Next Steps & Methods of Improvement</h2>
      <p class="text">TESTING: To hear from potential users.</p>
