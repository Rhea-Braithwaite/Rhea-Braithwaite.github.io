        <p class="overview">Overview: Mobile application that detects AI-manipulated audio in real-time
           to help protect users from voice-based fraud. </p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="project-heading">Background & Research</h2>
      <p class="text">In recent years, there have been increased cases of individuals answering
         the phone or engaging with audio, believed to be the voice of  a loved
         one or acquaintance only to discover it is artificially generated. This
         technology is commonly referred to as audio spoofing and falls within the
          broader realm of deepfakes: highly convincing Artificial Intelligence (AI)
           based audio-visual manipulations. Deepfake audio in particular is being
            increasingly used to manipulate victims into financial scams.</p>

      <h2 class="project-heading">Project's Goal</h2>
      <p class="text">This project’s goal is to make readily accessible a tool for individuals
        to verify if an audio is real or spoofed, and be notified in the event of
        the latter, so they can exercise caution. The application then includes an
        integrated machine learning model to detect any manipulated audio, as well
        as an interface for users to record the audio and be notified in real time
        if any is found. </p>

      <h2 class="project-heading">Methodology</h2>
      <div class="text-img-row">
        <div class="text-column">
          <p class="text">The first phase in this process was to develop a dataset of both spoofed and authentic
            audio samples, to evaluate a set of selected models. This dataset included
            a total of 17,312 audio clips: 8656 real and 8656 fake, across the
            different methods of creating deep fake audio including text-to-speech
            synthesis  (TTS) and voice conversion (VC) methods. </p>
            <p class="text">These clips were then pre-processed to reflect the conditions of the
              typical audio that would be analyzed by the app: phone calls. This process
               involved resampling the file to indicate compression and then randomly
               zeroing samples within the audios to indicate packet loss.</p>
            <p class="text">Using this dataset, 2 deep learning models with 3 front-end configurations
               were then evaluated and the best performing one was selected for
               integration into the app. </p>

      </div>

      <h2 class="project-heading">Digital Prototypes & App Implementation</h2>
      <p class="text">I then created high fidelity prototypes in Figma for the different screens
         of the user interface.</p>
      <img src="images/projects/safesound/digital_prototypes2.png" alt="Digital Prototypes" class="project-img">


      <p class="text">Using these as reference, I then developed in Android Studio with Kotlin
         the final applicaion, compressing and integrating the model using TensorflowLite, and adding real time user notifications. </p>

        <li>TESTING: to gather feedback on the app’s usability and
           effectiveness.</li>
        <li>Optimize the model for improved performance. This includes adjusting parameters and creating a larger more varied dataset. </li>
