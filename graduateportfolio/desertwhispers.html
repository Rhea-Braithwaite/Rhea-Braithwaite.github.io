        <p class="overview"> Overview: An interactive installation, centered around a single tree in
          the Sweihan Abu Dhabi desert, using sensors and LED lights to convey the
          tree’s limits of human interaction.

          </br> </br> Developed as the final project of the Desert Media Art course,
          which teaches key technical aspects of design such as prototyping and
          documentation. After splitting into teams of four, we used these newfound
          skills to research, propose, produce and install an electronic artwork
          designed for Abu Dhabi’s Sweihan desert.</p>

      <h2 class="project-heading">Early Steps</h2>

      <p class="text"> We each created our own individual ideas, mine of which was using wind
        chimes as a tool for the desert to voice itself.  </p>

      <h2 class="project-heading"> Site Visit and Final Idea </h2>
      <p class="text">After a visit to our installation site, we workshopped my early idea into an
        installation centered around a single tree we found.</p>

      <div class="text-img-row">
        <div class="text-column">
          <p class="text" >Using LED lights wrapped in 3D printed leaves and an ultrasonic distance
            sensor, the installation became a visual way for the tree to communicate
            its boundaries as humans interact with it. </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Green: Tree is in a healthy state</li>
              <li>Yellow: Approaching tree’s interaction limit</li>
              <li>Red: Tree is in distress as interaction limit has been exceeded </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text">The transition of the colors serve to make immediately visible the unseen
               stresses the environment endures due to human presence. Once the visitor
               walks away, the tree eventually returns to its earlier green and healthy
               state. </p>

      <h2 class="project-heading">Building</h2>
      <p class="text">I was once again on the technical side building the circuit, to include
        all the electronic pieces of the project. I then worked on writing the code to calibrate the ultrasonic sensor, and
           use its values to change the colors of the LED lights. </p>

        <img src="images/projects/desertwhispers/circuit.jpg" alt="Mobile App Screenshots" class="test">
        <img src="images/projects/desertwhispers/circuit2.jpeg" alt="Mobile App Screenshots" class="test">
      </div>

      <p class= "text">
         <br> <br> After one of our teammates printed the leaves, I then combined
         them with the LED lights attached to the circuit, and tested them to
         ensure they changed colors as the distance and time spent at certain
         distances changed.

         <br> <br> Together, we safely attached the pieces onto the tree for the
         final exhibition day, as another of our teammates documented the process.
